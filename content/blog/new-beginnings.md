It's the start of a new year.  A new decade really, and what's the one thing on everyone's mind?  What are your goals?  Do you have any resolutions?  What do you want to change from the previous year?!  Isn't it funny how at the end of each year we are about our "**Top Ten Moments**".  Yet the second December 31st hits and that new year begin it's all about setting new goals.  This year I noticed it more than ever.  I don't know if it was the start of the new decade or the start of a catchy sounding year.   Maybe it was everyone is tired of the hate in this country and is looking for something positive to look forward to?
